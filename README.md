# EduTtrack Student Feedback Manager

A basic tool for EduTtrack to collect initial student feedback via a command-line interface and perform rudimentary analysis by calculating average scores.

## Features

- *Feedback Submission (CLI):* Students can provide feedback through a simple command-line script (feedback_entry.py).
- *Data Storage (JSON):* Feedback data is currently stored in a local JSON file (student_feedback.json).
- *Basic Analysis (CLI):* Administrators can run a command-line script (score_calculator.py) to calculate the average overall and instructor ratings from the collected feedback.
- *Automated Testing:* Basic unit tests for the score_calculator.py are implemented using pytest (test_score_calculator.py).
- *Automated Testing Workflow:* A GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/test.yml) is set up to automatically run pytest tests on code pushes and pull requests.
- *Version Control:* The project is managed using Git, with collaboration facilitated through GitHub.
